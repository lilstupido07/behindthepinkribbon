    <h3>About Breast Cancer</h3>
    <p>
      Breast cancer is a disease where cells in the breast grow uncontrollably, forming a tumor that can often be felt as a lump or seen on an x-ray.
       In 2024, approximately 310,720 new cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed in women in the United States, and an estimated 42,250 women died from the disease . 
       Globally, breast cancer caused 670,000 deaths in 2022, making it the most common cancer among women in 157 out of 185 countries . 
       While the exact cause of breast cancer is not fully understood, certain risk factors such as age, family history, and lifestyle choices can increase the likelihood of developing the disease. 
       Early detection through regular screenings and self-exams is crucial, as it significantly improves treatment outcomes and survival rates. 
       Advancements in research and treatment have led to a 44% decline in breast cancer mortality rates since 1989 in the U.S., preventing approximately 517,900 deaths .

    Breast cancer is not a single disease, but a group of cancers that affect the cells in the breast in different ways. 
    Each type varies in how it behaves, where it begins, and how it responds to treatment.
     Knowing the differences between types of breast cancer can help patients and their families better understand diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options.
      Below are the most common types of breast cancer and key facts about each one.
  </p>

  <div class>
  <section>
    <details>
      <summary>Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS)</summary>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        A non-invasive cancer where abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct but haven’t spread. It’s considered the earliest form of breast cancer and is highly treatable.
      </div>
    </details>
  
    <details>
      <summary>Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)</summary>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        The most common type, IDC begins in the milk ducts and invades surrounding breast tissue. It accounts for about 80% of all breast cancer diagnoses.
      </div>
    </details>
  
    <details>
      <summary>Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC)</summary>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        Starts in the lobules (milk-producing glands) and spreads to nearby breast tissue. ILC tends to be harder to detect with mammograms.
      </div>
    </details>
  
    <details>
      <summary>Triple-Negative Breast Cancer</summary>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        A more aggressive type that doesn’t have estrogen, progesterone, or HER2 receptors. It grows and spreads faster and has fewer targeted treatment options.
      </div>
    </details>
  
    <details>
      <summary>HER2-Positive Breast Cancer</summary>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        A fast-growing type with high levels of the HER2 protein. While aggressive, it responds well to targeted therapies.
      </div>
    </details>
  
    <details>
      <summary>Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC)</summary>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        A rare but aggressive form that causes the breast to appear red, swollen, and warm. It tends to spread quickly and often doesn’t cause a lump.
      </div>
    </details>
  
    <details>
      <summary>Paget’s Disease of the Nipple</summary>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        A rare form that starts in the ducts and spreads to the nipple and areola. It may cause itching, redness, or flaking skin.
      </div>
    </details>
  
    <details>
      <summary>Metastatic Breast Cancer (Stage IV)</summary>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        Also called advanced breast cancer, it means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body like bones, liver, lungs, or brain.
