      <h2>Survivor Spotlight: Andy Sealy</h2>
      <p>
        At just 36 years old, Andy Sealy was leading a vibrant lifeâ€”working, spending time with friends, and enjoying her days with her dog. Breast cancer was the last thing on her mind until she discovered a lump during a routine self-exam. Initially diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, Andy opted for a double mastectomy. However, post-surgical findings revealed that 11 out of 13 lymph nodes were cancerous, escalating her diagnosis to stage IV metastatic breast cancer, with the disease having spread to her hip and spine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Confronted with this life-altering news, Andy chose to face her diagnosis with resilience and determination. She underwent comprehensive treatment, including surgery and systemic therapies, and embraced reconstructive procedures to restore her sense of self. Andy also collaborated with specialists for micropigmentation, aiming to reclaim her body image and confidence. Her journey underscores the importance of self-advocacy, early detection, and the strength found in facing adversity head-on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andy continues to share her story to inspire others, emphasizing that while the path is challenging, hope and strength can lead to empowerment and healing.
