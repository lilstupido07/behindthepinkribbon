    <p>Breast cancer treatment involves a multidisciplinary approach tailored to the unique characteristics of each patient’s diagnosis.
       Factors such as the cancer's stage, hormone receptor status, and genetic markers play a critical role in determining the most effective course of action.
        Treatment plans may include localized interventions, such as surgery and radiation therapy, as well as systemic therapies designed to target cancer cells throughout the body.
         The objective is to not only eliminate the tumor but also minimize the likelihood of recurrence and preserve long-term health.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Surgery</summary>
        <p>Surgery is often the first line of treatment for breast cancer and involves physically removing the tumor from the breast.
           The most common types are lumpectomy, which removes only the tumor and a small margin of surrounding tissue, and mastectomy, which removes one or both breasts entirely.
            In some cases, lymph nodes under the arm may also be removed to check for spread.
             Surgery is typically followed by additional treatments like radiation or chemotherapy to reduce recurrence risk.</p>
      </details>
  
      <details>
        <summary>Radiation Therapy</summary>
        <p>Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays or particles to destroy cancer cells left behind after surgery.
           It's often recommended after a lumpectomy or when cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.
            The goal is to lower the chances of recurrence in the breast or chest wall.
             Treatments are usually delivered daily over several weeks and are painless, although they may cause temporary skin irritation or fatigue.</p>
      </details>
  
      <details>
        <summary>Chemotherapy</summary>
        <p>Chemotherapy uses powerful drugs that travel through the bloodstream to kill rapidly dividing cancer cells throughout the body.
           It's often used when the cancer is aggressive, has spread beyond the breast, or to shrink tumors before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy).
            Side effects can include hair loss, nausea, fatigue, and a weakened immune system, but many are temporary and manageable.
             Chemo is typically given in cycles over several months.</p>
      </details>
  
      <details>
        <summary>Hormone Therapy</summary>
        <p>Hormone (or endocrine) therapy is used for breast cancers that are hormone receptor-positive, meaning they grow in response to estrogen or progesterone.
           Medications like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors work by blocking hormones or lowering their levels in the body.
            This therapy can last 5 to 10 years and is used to reduce the risk of recurrence after initial treatment.
             It may also be used to shrink tumors before surgery or treat advanced cancers.</p>
      </details>
  
      <details>
        <summary>Targeted Therapy</summary>
        <p>Targeted therapy uses drugs that specifically attack cancer cells with certain markers—like HER2-positive breast cancer—without harming most normal cells.
           Medications such as trastuzumab (Herceptin) and pertuzumab bind to the HER2 protein and block its function, slowing cancer growth.
            It’s often used alongside chemo for early-stage or metastatic cancer.
             Side effects tend to be less severe than chemotherapy but can include heart issues and fatigue.</p>
      </details>
  
      <details>
        <summary>Immunotherapy</summary>
        <p>Immunotherapy helps your immune system recognize and destroy cancer cells more effectively.
           While it's not yet widely used for all breast cancers, it's showing promise especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a more aggressive type.
            Drugs like checkpoint inhibitors remove the "brakes" that keep immune cells from attacking cancer.
             Side effects vary but can include inflammation in organs and flu-like symptoms.</p>
      </details>
  
      <details>
        <summary>Adjuvant Therapy</summary>
        <p>Adjuvant therapy refers to any treatment given after the main treatment, usually surgery, to lower the risk of the cancer returning.
           It can include radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or targeted therapy depending on the cancer type and stage.
            The goal is to kill any remaining microscopic cancer cells that couldn’t be detected.
             This approach has been shown to significantly improve long-term survival rates.</p>
